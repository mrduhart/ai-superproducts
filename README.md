# AI Superproducts

This repo contains a list of resources and notes about artificial intelligence, web development, databases, and even product design. More specifically, it covers the following topics:

- Artificial intelligence
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Django web development
- Non-relational databases
- Web scraping
- Software engineering
- Explainable AI
- Design thinking

## Why this repo

Because there's something I've been asking about for a long time, but no one has answered me yet. Therefore, I looked for the answer myself. And so this marks the start of a not-so-short journey for me. The journey of finding the answer to my question:

> How to build AI superproducts?

And what is that?

I'm talking about products with an AI-based component, which are designed from the beginning with the users in mind, and which solve their needs in a very effective and efficient way.

I'm talking about AI that does not break and does not look like black magic.

I'm talking about dealing with the ambiguities and huge uncertainty that come with the development of AI products.

I'm talking about AI done right.

## The Fountain of Wisdom

Below, I compile the best resources I've gathered about many different topics for the creation of AI products.

They are presented in the order that I used them to supercharge my skills, which goes from introductory and practice-oriented materials, towards deeper theoretical resources.

The process for selecting them was something like this:

1. **Google for ```best books/way to learn [insert your thing]```.**

2. **Have a quick look at the main results.**

These were usually lists of the best books on the topic.

3. **Pick a few of the books in these lists based on their title and description.**

I tried to focus on books that had a practical approach to the topic.

4. **Sort the picks by ratings.**

For that, I mostly used Amazon ratings to compare all picks on the same basis. If other ratings were available for all the books, like Goodreads, then I used that instead.

5. **Look at the contents of the sorted picks, and also at the comments from other readers, to filter out the less-than-great options.**

This way, I could get a grasp of how good the book would fit my needs, by considering things like tone and style of the author, target level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, Super Saiyan), completeness, and if it was up to date with the latest versions and practices.

6. **Finally, I came up with a sort of learning path by defining the order in which I would use the resources for myself.**

Now, to the sources of knowledge.
