- Importance of process
  - Innovative (modern software) vs routine (established software), both need a **process: activities + results -> product**
  - A simple process (is it?)
    1. Discuss software to write
    2. Code
    3. Test: find issues
    4. Debug: find causes
    4. Fix
    5. Repeat (or end)
  - Process + coding + rework not linear
    - No process -> lots of trashing, lots of process eventually (by the end)
    - More process at beginning -> less trashing, less process by the end - survival mode
    - Earlier defects are more costly to correct later

- Automation
  - Routine is automated to avoid repetition
    - Copy/paste -> method -> lib
    - Common problems & SW -> frameworks
    - Data gathering -> list comprehension -> DB queries
    - ...
  - Version control is great
    - History, robustness, collaboration, clean files
    - Make good commits
    - Release management
    - Track source, docs, and configs (no generated files or private info)
  - Docs
    - Great code should not need it
      - Descriptive method & variable names
      - Constants vs magic numbers
    - ...but makes it better
      - Rationale vs code repetition
      - API interfaces
  - Builds
    - Command line steps -> scripts -> build tools
    - Test in other machines
  - Quality
    - Dynamic: Manual testing -> unit testing & coverage -> CI & CD
    - Static: Code inspection -> static analysis / formal verification
    - Process
  - Issue tracking
    - Manual -> tracking systems -> AI
    - Measurement: when, who, what, difficulty
    - Communication and accountability

- Planning, requirements, and design
  - Planning is everyting, the plan is nothing
    - Iterate and replan when something changes
    - Practice and calibration to estimate effort - IT IS DIFFICULT!
    - Milestones with objective deliverables vs progress estimates
  - Requirements
    - What vs how
    - Hard to establish and rectify, wrong requirements ruin result (Fred Brooks)
    - Functional vs **Quality (guide tradeoff)**
    - Remember qualities? Use, product, process
  - Measurement
    - Rule from model / theory -> numbers -> properties
    - Observations -> less uncertainty
    - Everyting is measurable: X is important -> X is detectable -> X is detectable in some amount -> X is measurable
    - Learn -> build -> measure: goal -> question -> metric (SCIENCE!!!)
  - Design
    - **Make tradeoff decisions (core of software engineering)**
    - Constraints, priorities, analysis w/o implementation

- Software Development Life Cyle (models)
  - Phases: requirements -> design -> implementation -> testing -> deployment -> maintenance
  - Waterfall: phases are all linear, bad at risk (changes) and scale, obsolete but good for small and short projects with clear requirements
    - V-shaped (Validation and Verification): emphasis on testing (good for some projects), dev-test pairs by levels, very rigid
  - Iterative: phases happen in repeating cycles (iterations, duh), one iteration ~= waterfall, good for risks (high-risk task first), more demanding, requires specialists (mainly for risk) and constant management, overhead for small projects
    - Spiral: prototypes by stages (early delivery), more incremental than iterative, fixed timeframes for switching (even when not done), excessive documentation (?), too complex
  - Agile: great for risk and uncertainty (constant changes), all phases happen all the time (fast delivery), bit of a mess, requires lots of communication & self-organization (highly professional, skilled, integrated and client-oriented teams), estimations of cost and time are more difficult, might exceed expected times
    - XP: pair programming and other crazy stuff
    - Scrum: all about roles and rituals
    - Manifesto
      - **Individuals and interactions** > processes and tools
      - **Working software** > comprehensive documentation
      - **Customer collaboration** > contract negotiation
      - **Responding to change** > following a plan
  - **Kanban is an approach for process improvement, NOT A SDLC METHODOLOGY**
    - Principles
      - Start where you are (gradual / incremental changes)
      - Fuck the roles: let everyone be what they already are and respect egos
      - Everyone can (and should) be a leader
    - Practices
      - Make work visual (board): workflow, capacity (WIP) and policies (should be explicit!)
      - Limit WIP
      - Keep it flowing (manage flow)
      - Experiment to evolve: observe -> collaborate to improve -> small changes -> feedback
  - Best practices
    - Kanban board
    - Simple communication (let's just talk about it)
      - Whiteboards and mind maps
      - Simple diagrams (use cases rock)
      - Highly involved customer
    - Story maps
    - Risk analysis (not as boring as it sounds)
    - Iterative and incremental development
      - Short cycles
    - Work capacity estimation & work limits
    - Constant refactoring (vs too much design)
    - Testing (test-driven development)
    - Automation
