- Different goals between data scientist and software engineer.
  - Data scientist: focused on accuracy, fast prototypes (notebooks), fixed dataset, improve model
  - Software engineer: quality, testing, comply with requirements, cost, scalability, maintenance, performance beyond accuracy, error-handling

- Quality is more than no defects: functional, reliable, usable, delightful (Garvin's 8 categories: features, performance, reliability, conformance, durability, serviceability, aesthetics, perceived quality)

- Contracts/specifications
  - Expected behavior (hiding implementation)
  - Responsibilities
  - Invariants (preconditions and postconditions)
  - What is correct and exceptional behavior

-  ML specifications are unusual
  - Utilized in complex tasks, alrady already to specify
  - Focused on goals (maximize accuracy)
  - Rules are learn implicitly (can't be given beforehand)

- ML is inductive reasoning: observations -> general rules

- Former AI (formal logic, expert systems, rule-based learners) is deductive: general rules -> predictions -> results

- Specifications in real-life were already vague if they even exist (formal proofs are rare). The problem and solutions are not entirely new.
